## Keywords
The verbs in the function names indicate what kind of function you are dealing with.
- detect: returns typed string
- decrypt: giiven a cryptic string it returrns a sanitized string
- generate: generates a new URL
- is: returns a boolean
- to: ultimate function that combines all different method to get from the start to the end result

## Choices
I made a few controversial choices. Instead of returning strings, all generate functions return a URL, which of course can be converted back to a string.
